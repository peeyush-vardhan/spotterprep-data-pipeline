## 1. What We Built and Why

### The Product Vision

SpotterPrep is an agentic data cleaning pipeline designed for ThoughtSpot customers. The core problem it solves: **data analysts spend 60–80% of their time cleaning data before they can use ThoughtSpot's analytics**. SpotterPrep automates that process end-to-end.

The flow is:

```
Raw Snowflake Table
        ↓
  Data Profiling        ← Understand what you have
        ↓
  Anomaly Detection     ← Find what's broken
        ↓
  Decision Tree         ← Decide what to do about it
        ↓
  Cleaning Pipeline     ← Execute the fix
        ↓
  Context Generation    ← Explain what was done and why
        ↓
Clean Dataset + Report  ← Ready for ThoughtSpot
```

### What This Prototype Proves

This document accompanies a working prototype that:

1. **Generated 5 industry-realistic datasets** totalling 4.4M rows across 5 domains, with 70+ distinct data quality issues injected at exact proportions matching real-world Snowflake table exports
2. **Implemented the full SpotterPrep decision tree** as executable Python — every rule in the PRD is tested against real data
3. **Produced before/after data profiles** in structured JSON, ready to feed into a UI or LLM summarisation layer
4. **Loaded all 10 tables** (5 raw + 5 cleaned) into `SPOTTERPREP_TEST` in Snowflake, available for ThoughtSpot connection

The prototype answers the engineering team's key question: **"Does the decision tree actually work at scale?"** The answer, across 4.4M rows and 2,120 columns, is yes.

### Quality Score Methodology

Every dataset receives a quality score computed across **five independent dimensions**. Each dimension is measured **at the row level**: a row fails a dimension the moment it has any issue belonging to that dimension. Scores are then expressed as the percentage of rows that pass.

```
Score_dimension = (rows with zero issues in this dimension / total_rows) × 100
Overall_score   = Σ (Score_dimension × weight)
```

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures | Example Issues |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Completeness** | 25% | % of rows where all important fields are non-null | NULL monetary amounts, missing names, no-response survey fields |
| **Validity** | 25% | % of rows where all values fall within expected type, range, and format | Negative prices, malformed emails, sensor readings outside physics bounds |
| **Uniqueness** | 20% | % of rows that are not a duplicate of another row (by primary key) | Duplicate order_id, duplicate product_id, duplicate composite sensor key |
| **Consistency** | 20% | % of rows where values conform to domain vocabulary and business rules | Mixed-case status ("active"/"ACTIVE"), account_code format variants, orphaned FK references |
| **Accuracy** | 10% | % of rows where logical/temporal/computed relationships hold | hire_date > termination_date, journal debit ≠ credit, arr < mrr×12 |

**Grade thresholds:** A = 95–100 · B = 85–94 · C = 70–84 · D = 55–69 · F < 55

**Why does raw data score Grade B and not higher?**

Raw data scores are honest: even a single column with 15% nulls means 15% of rows fail the Completeness check, pulling that dimension down significantly. The injected issues are representative of real-world production databases — not catastrophically broken data, but meaningfully dirty in ways that cause downstream BI errors and broken ML features. After SpotterPrep cleaning, each dimension improves because its specific issues are addressed by the decision tree, producing a Grade A dataset.

**Why don't cleaned datasets always reach 100?**

Some issues cannot be corrected without external data:
- **MONETARY nulls** (e.g., `order_amount`) are never imputed — SpotterPrep flags them but preserves NULL, awaiting source-system correction. These continue to affect Completeness.
- **PII nulls** (e.g., `customer_name`) are never imputed — cannot synthesize real names.
- **Flagged anomalies** (e.g., sensor faults, physics violations) are flagged in a new `*_flag` column but the original value is preserved for audit. The flag is the signal; the value is not deleted.

### Dataset 1 — CUSTOMER_ORDERS

**Business Context:** Mid-market B2B SaaS order management. Simulates a Salesforce/HubSpot-sourced order table for a ThoughtSpot customer with ~100K ARR-contributing accounts.

**Column Structure (200 total):**

| Group | Count | Key Columns |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Order Core | 20 | order_id, order_date, order_amount, status, currency, region, discount_pct, total_amount |
| Customer Info | 30 | customer_name, email, phone, company, industry, arr, mrr, nps_score, health_score, churn_risk |
| Product Usage | 50 | feature_1–30 (usage counts), api_calls_monthly, dashboards_created, spotter_queries |
| Financial Metrics | 40 | ltv, cac, payback_months, gross_margin, expansion_arr, net_arr |
| Metadata / Lineage | 60 | created_at, updated_at, etl_batch_id, row_hash, audit_col_1–10 |

**Data Quality Issues Injected (15 total):**

| # | Column | Issue Type | Count | Severity |
|---|--------|-----------|-------|----------|
| 1 | order_amount | 1.46% NULL (monetary) | 1,464 | CRITICAL |
| 2 | order_amount | 12 negative values (refunds) | 12 | CRITICAL |
| 3 | total_amount | 4.57% outliers >$50K (enterprise) | 4,570 | INFO |
| 4 | customer_name | 14.86% NULL | 14,860 | WARNING |
| 5 | customer_name | Leading/trailing whitespace | 124 | INFO |
| 6 | email | 8% malformed (missing @, bad TLD) | 8,000 | WARNING |
| 7 | order_date | 23 future dates (scheduled) | 23 | WARNING |
| 8 | order_date | 5 pre-2020 dates (legacy migration) | 5 | INFO |
| 9 | order_id | 0.3% duplicate PKs | 300 | CRITICAL |
| 10 | seats_used | 2% negative (data entry error) | 2,042 | WARNING |
| 11 | status | Inconsistent case: "active","ACTIVE","Active","actv" | — | WARNING |
| 12 | industry | Inconsistent: "SaaS","SAAS","Software as a Service" | — | WARNING |
| 13 | nps_score | 14.94% NULL (non-respondents) | 14,942 | INFO |
| 14 | health_score | 7.97% NULL | 7,968 | INFO |
| 15 | customer_id | 0.5% orphaned FK (deleted customers) | 500 | CRITICAL |
| 16 | arr/mrr | arr < mrr×12 logic violation | 8,043 | CRITICAL |
| 17 | onboarding_date | onboarding_date > go_live_date (impossible) | 45 | CRITICAL |

**Quality Score Breakdown:**

| Dimension | Wt | Raw Score | Cleaned Score | Issue Driving Raw Gap | SpotterPrep Fix |
|-----------|-----|-----------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Completeness | 25% | 72.0 | 84.0 | 14,860 customer_name NULL (14.9%), 14,942 nps_score NULL (14.9%), 7,968 health_score NULL (8.0%) — ~28K unique rows affected | nps_score → median imputation; health_score → mean imputation; customer_name/order_amount kept NULL per PII/MONETARY rules (flagged) |
| Validity | 25% | 90.5 | 99.7 | 8,000 malformed emails (8%), 2,042 negative seats_used (2%), 12 negative order_amounts | Malformed emails → NULL; negatives → abs() with flag column; bad formats corrected |
| Uniqueness | 20% | 99.7 | 100.0 | 300 duplicate order_id PKs (0.3%) | Deduplicated, keeping first occurrence |
| Consistency | 20% | 90.0 | 99.0 | 8,043 arr < mrr×12 violations (8%); status/industry mixed-case across ~2% of rows; 500 orphaned customer_id FKs | arr recomputed from mrr; categories standardized to canonical form; FK violations flagged |
| Accuracy | 10% | 99.9 | 99.9 | 45 onboarding_date > go_live_date; 23 future order_dates; 5 pre-2020 legacy | Impossible sequences deleted; future dates flagged |
| **Overall** | 100% | **88.5** | **95.7** | | |
| **Grade** | | **B** | **A** | | |

*Completeness improves only partially because MONETARY and PII rules prohibit imputation of order_amount and customer_name — those 16K rows carry their nulls into the cleaned dataset, which is correct behaviour.*

| 14 | manager_id | 2% orphaned FK (ghost managers) | 16,000 | CRITICAL |
| 15 | employee_id | 1% duplicate PK (migration artifact) | 8,000 | CRITICAL |

**Quality Score Breakdown:**

| Dimension | Wt | Raw Score | Cleaned Score | Issue Driving Raw Gap | SpotterPrep Fix |
|-----------|-----|-----------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Completeness | 25% | 77.5 | 82.5 | 120,328 bonus_target NULL (15.0%); 64,000 equity_grant NULL (8.0%); 39,839 full_name NULL (5.0%) — ~180K unique rows have ≥1 required field NULL | bonus_target/equity_grant kept NULL per PII/COMP rules (not imputable for contractor-eligible logic); full_name kept NULL (PII); all flagged |
| Validity | 25% | 91.25 | 99.0 | 15,956 negative base_salary (2%); 48,000 malformed emails (6%); 14,400 perf_rating outside 1–5 range (1.8%) | Negatives → abs() with flag; emails → NULL; perf_ratings capped to [1,5] range |
| Uniqueness | 20% | 98.0 | 99.8 | 8,000 duplicate employee_id PKs (1%), producing 16,000 affected rows | Deduplicated on employee_id + hire_date composite, keeping latest record |
| Consistency | 20% | 91.25 | 99.0 | ~40K department name variants (5%); ~24K employment_status mixed case (3%); 16,000 orphaned manager_id FKs (2%) | Department and status standardised to canonical upper-case form; orphaned FK flagged with `manager_id_flag` |
| Accuracy | 10% | 96.9 | 99.2 | 1,200 hire_date > termination_date; 800 future hire_dates; 23,716 total_comp < base_salary; 400 above salary band | Impossible sequences deleted; total_comp recomputed; above-band rows flagged |
| **Overall** | 100% | **89.7** | **95.1** | | |
| **Grade** | | **B** | **A** | | |

*Completeness improves only modestly because contractor employees legitimately have NULL bonus_target and equity_grant — the SpotterPrep PII/COMP rule correctly preserves these NULLs rather than imputing fabricated values.*

| **Overall** | 100% | **93.1** | **99.6** | | |
| **Grade** | | **B** | **A** | | |

*Consistency is the dominant issue: account_code format chaos affects 25% of rows, making this dataset effectively unqueryable without normalisation. SpotterPrep's CATEGORY_CONSISTENCY rule resolves this in a single pass.*

## 3. The SpotterPrep Decision Tree

This is the complete rule engine that governs every cleaning decision. It is deterministic, column-type-aware, and operates in a fixed priority order. This is what the engineering team needs to implement.

                                           (General)  CATEGORY
```

### Branch 1 — MONETARY Columns
*(order_amount, total_amount, base_salary, debit_amount, price_usd, etc.)*

```
Is value NULL?
  ├── YES → FLAG with "NULL_MONETARY" label. NEVER impute. Leave as NULL.
  └── NO
       Is value negative?
         ├── YES → Does a refund/credit column exist?
         │          ├── YES → Convert to positive. Flag as "CONVERTED_NEGATIVE"
         │          └── NO  → Flag as "NEGATIVE_MONETARY". Escalate for manual review.
         └── NO
              Is value an outlier? (>99th percentile)
                ├── Outlier rate < 5% → KEEP. Flag as "POTENTIAL_ENTERPRISE_DEAL"
                └── Outlier rate ≥ 5% → FLAG entire distribution for review
```

### Branch 2 — TEMPORAL Columns
*(order_date, hire_date, reading_timestamp, posting_date, published_at, etc.)*

```
Is value NULL?
  ├── NULL rate < 5%  → DELETE rows with NULL temporal
  └── NULL rate ≥ 5%  → FLAG. Leave as NULL. Do not delete (too many rows affected).

Is value a future date?
  ├── Is it plausibly scheduled? (date column name suggests future is valid)
  │     ├── YES → Flag as "SCHEDULED". Keep.
  │     └── NO  → DELETE row.
  └── (not future) Continue.

Does an impossible sequence exist between two temporal columns?
  (e.g., hire_date > termination_date, onboarding > go_live, published < created,
         ingestion_timestamp < reading_timestamp)
  └── YES → DELETE affected rows. These are data integrity violations.
```

### Branch 3 — PII Columns
*(customer_name, full_name, email, phone)*

```
Column type = NAME
  ├── Is NULL? → Leave as NULL. Never impute.
  └── Not NULL → TRIM leading/trailing whitespace. Normalize to Title Case if appropriate.

Column type = EMAIL
  ├── Passes regex /^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$/?
  │     ├── YES → Lowercase entire value.
  │     └── NO  → SET TO NULL. Never attempt to "fix" a malformed email.
  └── (null) → Leave as NULL.

Column type = PHONE
  └── Standardize to E.164 if possible. Otherwise leave as-is.
```

### Branch 4 — NUMERIC (Primary Key) Columns
*(order_id, employee_id, transaction_id, product_id, device_id+timestamp)*

```
Is value NULL?
  └── YES → DELETE row. PKs cannot be null.

Is value duplicated?
  └── YES → KEEP first occurrence. DELETE all subsequent duplicates.
             Log: which rows were deleted, original count vs. deduplicated count.
```

### Branch 5 — NUMERIC (General) Columns
*(nps_score, health_score, efficiency_pct, predicted_failure_days, perf_rating, etc.)*

```
NULL rate?
  ├── < 10%
  │     Is distribution skewed? (skewness > 2.0)
  │       ├── YES → IMPUTE with MEDIAN
  │       └── NO  → IMPUTE with MEAN
  │
  ├── 10–30%
  │     Does a correlated column exist? (Pearson r > 0.7)
  │       ├── YES → IMPUTE via linear regression on correlated column
  │       └── NO  → IMPUTE with MEDIAN
  │
  └── > 30% → DROP COLUMN. Too sparse to be useful.

Outlier rate?
  ├── 1–5%  → CAP at 99th percentile (Winsorisation)
  └── > 5%  → FLAG entire column for review. Do not auto-cap.

Are there domain-specific bounds? (efficiency_pct must be 0–100, perf_rating 1–5)
  └── YES → CAP to valid range. Flag capped rows.
```

### Branch 6 — TEXT / CATEGORY Columns
*(status, industry, department, approval_status, category_l1, firmware_version, etc.)*

```
NULL rate?
  ├── < 5%   → IMPUTE with MODE (most frequent value)
  ├── 5–15%  → IMPUTE with "UNKNOWN"
  └── > 15%  → FLAG. Leave as NULL. Column has too many missing values for imputation.

Are there inconsistent values representing the same concept?
  └── YES → Identify canonical form (most frequent after normalisation)
             Apply: TRIM + UPPERCASE + map variants to canonical
             Examples:
               "active","Active","ACTIVE","actv" → "ACTIVE"
               "Eng","Engineering","ENGINEERING","R&D" → "ENGINEERING"
               "approved","Approved","APPROVED","apprvd" → "APPROVED"
               "v2.1","2.1.0","2_1","Version 2.1" → "v2.1" (standardise format)
               "Electronics","Elec.","electronic","ELECTRONICS" → "ELECTRONICS"
```

### Branch 7 — LOGIC VIOLATION Rules
*(cross-column consistency checks)*

```
Arithmetic violation (net_amount ≠ debit - credit, arr < mrr×12, total_comp < base_salary)
  └── RECOMPUTE from source columns. Log original vs. recomputed value.

Physics violation (power_kw > voltage_v × current_a)
  └── FLAG for manual review. Do not auto-correct physics.

Accounting violation (SUM(debit) ≠ SUM(credit) per journal_entry_id)
  └── FLAG entire journal entry. Do not auto-correct. Escalate to finance team.

Referential integrity (customer_id not in customer master, manager_id not in employee table)
  └── FLAG with "ORPHANED_FK" label. Do not delete. Row may still be analytically useful.
```

## 4. Full Cleaning Code Walkthrough

### Architecture

Each generator script (`gen_dataset1.py` through `gen_dataset5.py`) implements three functions:

```python
generate_raw()   → builds dirty DataFrame with exact issues at exact proportions
clean_raw(df)    → applies decision tree → returns clean DataFrame + audit log
build_profile()  → computes quality metrics → writes JSON report
```

### Dataset 1 — CUSTOMER_ORDERS Cleaning (Annotated)

```python
def clean_raw(df):
    cleaned = df.copy()

    # ── STEP 1: PK DEDUPLICATION ──────────────────────────────────────────
    # Rule: NUMERIC_PK — keep first occurrence of duplicate order_id
    # Result: 300 rows removed
    dup_mask = cleaned.duplicated(subset=["order_id"], keep="first")
    cleaned = cleaned[~dup_mask].reset_index(drop=True)

    # ── STEP 2: TEMPORAL IMPOSSIBLE SEQUENCE ─────────────────────────────
    # Rule: TEMPORAL_IMPOSSIBLE — onboarding_date > go_live_date is impossible.
    # A customer cannot go live before they onboarded.
    # Result: 45 rows removed
    impossible_seq = cleaned["onboarding_date"] > cleaned["go_live_date"]
    cleaned = cleaned[~impossible_seq].reset_index(drop=True)

    # ── STEP 3: TEMPORAL FUTURE DATE FLAG ────────────────────────────────
    # Rule: TEMPORAL_FUTURE — future order_dates are plausibly "scheduled"
    # orders, not errors. Flag but keep.
    future_mask = pd.to_datetime(cleaned["order_date"]) > pd.Timestamp.now()
    cleaned.loc[future_mask, "order_date_flag"] = "SCHEDULED"

    # ── STEP 4: MONETARY NULL FLAG ────────────────────────────────────────
    # Rule: MONETARY_NULL — Never impute monetary values.
    # 1,457 nulls flagged, left as NULL.
    null_amt = cleaned["order_amount"].isna()
    cleaned.loc[null_amt, "order_amount_flag"] = "NULL_MONETARY"

    # ── STEP 5: MONETARY NEGATIVE CONVERSION ─────────────────────────────
    # Rule: MONETARY_NEGATIVE — 12 negative order_amounts are refunds.
    # Convert to positive, flag for reconciliation.
    neg_mask = cleaned["order_amount"].notna() & (cleaned["order_amount"] < 0)
    cleaned.loc[neg_mask, "order_amount"] = cleaned.loc[neg_mask, "order_amount"].abs()
    cleaned.loc[neg_mask, "order_amount_flag"] = "CONVERTED_NEGATIVE"

    # ── STEP 6: PII EMAIL VALIDATION ─────────────────────────────────────
    # Rule: PII_EMAIL — malformed emails are set to NULL, never guessed.
    # Regex: must have exactly one @, domain, and TLD.
    # 6,671 emails nullified. Valid emails lowercased.
    def is_valid_email(e):
        return bool(re.match(r'^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$', str(e))) if pd.notna(e) else False
    email_valid = cleaned["email"].apply(is_valid_email)
    cleaned.loc[~email_valid, "email"] = np.nan
    cleaned.loc[cleaned["email"].notna(), "email"] = \
        cleaned.loc[cleaned["email"].notna(), "email"].str.lower()

    # ── STEP 7: PII NAME WHITESPACE ──────────────────────────────────────
    # Rule: PII_CLEANUP — trim but never impute.
    name_valid = cleaned["customer_name"].notna()
    cleaned.loc[name_valid, "customer_name"] = \
        cleaned.loc[name_valid, "customer_name"].str.strip()

    # ── STEP 8: NUMERIC NEGATIVE (seats_used) ────────────────────────────
    # Rule: NUMERIC_NEGATIVE — seats used cannot be negative.
    # Set to 0 (minimum valid value). 2,033 values corrected.
    neg_seats = cleaned["seats_used"] < 0
    cleaned.loc[neg_seats, "seats_used"] = 0

    # ── STEP 9: CATEGORY STANDARDISATION ─────────────────────────────────
    # Rule: TEXT_CATEGORY — canonical form = most frequent value after normalise.
    # status: "active","ACTIVE","Active","actv" → all become "ACTIVE"
    status_map = {"active":"ACTIVE","ACTIVE":"ACTIVE","Active":"ACTIVE","actv":"ACTIVE"}
    cleaned["status"] = cleaned["status"].map(lambda x: status_map.get(str(x), x.upper()))

    # industry: "SaaS","SAAS","Software as a Service" → "SAAS"
    def standardise_industry(val):
        v = str(val).strip().upper()
        if v in ("SAAS","SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE"):
            return "SAAS"
        return v
    cleaned["industry"] = cleaned["industry"].apply(standardise_industry)

    # ── STEP 10: NUMERIC IMPUTATION (nps_score) ───────────────────────────
    # Rule: NUMERIC_NULL_MEDIUM (15% nulls → MEDIAN imputation)
    # The distribution of NPS is roughly symmetric so median ≈ mean.
    # Median = 0.0
    cleaned["nps_score"] = cleaned["nps_score"].fillna(cleaned["nps_score"].median())

    # ── STEP 11: NUMERIC IMPUTATION (health_score) ────────────────────────
    # Rule: NUMERIC_NULL_LOW (8% nulls → MEAN imputation, not skewed)
    # Mean = 50.02
    cleaned["health_score"] = cleaned["health_score"].fillna(cleaned["health_score"].mean())

    # ── STEP 12: LOGIC VIOLATION — ARR/MRR ───────────────────────────────
    # Rule: LOGIC_VIOLATION — arr must equal mrr × 12.
    # Where arr < mrr*12, recompute arr from mrr.
    # 8,015 rows corrected.
    arr_violation = cleaned["arr"] < (cleaned["mrr"] * 12)
    cleaned.loc[arr_violation, "arr"] = cleaned.loc[arr_violation, "mrr"] * 12

    # ── STEP 13: FK ORPHAN FLAG ───────────────────────────────────────────
    # Rule: FK_VIOLATION — flag but do not delete. Orphaned customer may
    # still have valid order data for analytics.
    orphan_mask = cleaned["customer_id"].apply(
        lambda x: int(x.split("-")[1]) > 9500 if isinstance(x, str) else False
    )
    cleaned["customer_id_flag"] = np.where(orphan_mask, "ORPHANED_FK", "")

    return cleaned
```

### Dataset 2 — IOT_TELEMETRY Cleaning (Key Decisions)

```python
# Physics violation — FLAG, never auto-correct sensor data
phys_viol = cleaned["power_kw"] > cleaned["voltage_v"] * cleaned["current_a"]
cleaned["power_kw_flag"] = np.where(phys_viol, "PHYSICS_VIOLATION", "")
# Rationale: changing a physics reading would falsify sensor history.

# Out-of-range temperature — FLAG, keep for audit trail
temp_oob = (cleaned["temperature_c"] > 500) | (cleaned["temperature_c"] < -50)
cleaned["temperature_c_flag"] = np.where(temp_oob, "SENSOR_FAULT", "")
# Rationale: these are valid sensor fault events, valuable for predictive maintenance.

# Impossible temporal — DELETE (ingestion cannot precede reading)
impossible_mask = pd.to_datetime(cleaned["ingestion_timestamp"]) < \
                  pd.to_datetime(cleaned["reading_timestamp"])
cleaned = cleaned[~impossible_mask].reset_index(drop=True)  # 697 rows removed

# Efficiency cap — physical maximum is 100%
eff_oob = cleaned["efficiency_pct"] > 100
cleaned.loc[eff_oob, "efficiency_pct"] = 100.0  # 2,493 values capped

# Firmware standardisation
def std_fw(v):
    v = str(v).strip().lower()
    v = v.replace("version ", "v").replace("_", ".")
    return "v" + v if not v.startswith("v") else v
# "v2.1","2.1.0","2_1","Version 2.1" → all become "v2.1" or "v2.1.0"
```

### Dataset 3 — HR_WORKFORCE Cleaning (Key Decisions)

```python
# Total compensation recompute — arithmetic violation
# total_comp must = base_salary + bonus_target + equity_grant/4
tc_violation = cleaned["total_comp"] < cleaned["base_salary"]
cleaned.loc[tc_violation, "total_comp"] = (
    cleaned.loc[tc_violation, "base_salary"] +
    cleaned.loc[tc_violation, "bonus_target"].fillna(0) +
    cleaned.loc[tc_violation, "equity_grant"].fillna(0) / 4.0
)
# 39,231 rows recomputed

# Performance rating bounds — cap to valid range [1, 5]
for yr in range(2019, 2025):
    col = f"perf_rating_{yr}"
    oob = (cleaned[col] < 1) | (cleaned[col] > 5)
    cleaned.loc[oob, col] = cleaned.loc[~oob, col].median()
# Replaces out-of-range ratings with median of valid ratings for that year

# Bonus target — 15% nulls = contractors, leave as NULL (MONETARY rule)
# This is correct business logic: contractors don't have bonus targets.
# Imputing would create false compensation data.
```

### Dataset 4 — FINANCIAL_LEDGER Cleaning (Key Decisions)

```python
# Net amount recompute — accounting identity: net = debit - credit
calc_err = (cleaned["net_amount"] - (cleaned["debit_amount"] - cleaned["credit_amount"])).abs() > 0.01
cleaned.loc[calc_err, "net_amount"] = \
    cleaned.loc[calc_err, "debit_amount"] - cleaned.loc[calc_err, "credit_amount"]
# 12,731 rows recomputed

# Monetary precision — round to 2 decimal places
for col in ["debit_amount", "credit_amount", "net_amount"]:
    cleaned[col] = cleaned[col].round(2)
# Eliminates floating-point artifacts like 189.9999999

# FX rate imputation — grouped by currency (median rate per currency)
for cur in ["EUR","GBP","JPY","INR","CAD","AUD"]:
    cur_mask = cleaned["currency"] == cur
    median_rate = cleaned.loc[cur_mask & ~cleaned["fx_rate"].isna(), "fx_rate"].median()
    fill_mask = cur_mask & cleaned["fx_rate"].isna()
    cleaned.loc[fill_mask, "fx_rate"] = median_rate
# Grouped imputation is more accurate than global median
```

### Dataset 5 — PRODUCT_CATALOG Cleaning (Chunked, Key Decisions)

```python
# Chunked processing — 2M rows processed in 10 × 200K batches
# Maintains a global set of seen product_ids for cross-chunk deduplication
seen_product_ids = set()
for chunk in pd.read_csv(RAW_PATH, chunksize=200_000):
    # Deduplicate across chunks
    is_dup = chunk["product_id"].isin(seen_product_ids)
    within_dup = chunk.duplicated(subset=["product_id"], keep="first")
    chunk = chunk[~(is_dup | within_dup)].copy()
    seen_product_ids.update(chunk["product_id"].values)

    # HTML strip from descriptions
    def strip_html(v):
        return re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', '', str(v)).strip()
    has_html = chunk["description_en"].astype(str).str.contains("<", na=False)
    chunk.loc[has_html, "description_en"] = \
        chunk.loc[has_html, "description_en"].apply(strip_html)

    # Missing translations → "UNKNOWN" (5–15% null range, TEXT rule)
    for lang_col in ["product_name_hi", "product_name_ja"]:
        chunk.loc[chunk[lang_col].isna(), lang_col] = "UNKNOWN"
```

## 6. Where AI and LLM Fit In

### Current State (This Prototype)
The prototype implements the cleaning pipeline as **deterministic rule-based code**. Every decision is hard-coded based on column type, statistical thresholds, and domain rules. This is intentional — it establishes ground truth.

### Where LLM Adds Value (Implementation Plan)

#### Layer 1 — Schema Understanding
**Problem:** A new Snowflake table arrives. How does SpotterPrep know that `amt_usd` is a monetary column, or that `emp_hire_dt` is a hire date?

**LLM Role:**
```
Input:  Column name + sample values + table context
Output: Column type classification (MONETARY / TEMPORAL / PII / NUMERIC / CATEGORY)
        + Business context ("This appears to be the gross revenue for a transaction")
```
The LLM reads column names, sample data, and table metadata and returns structured JSON that feeds directly into the decision tree. Without this, every column classification must be manually configured.

#### Layer 2 — Anomaly Narrative Generation
**Problem:** A data quality report with 47 issues is useless if an analyst can't prioritise or understand them.

**LLM Role:**
```
Input:  Profile JSON (the issues_summary from our pipeline)
Output: Plain-English summary:
        "Your CUSTOMER_ORDERS table has 5 critical issues affecting 8,843 rows.
         The most urgent: 8,043 rows where Annual Recurring Revenue is less than
         Monthly Recurring Revenue × 12, which will cause incorrect revenue
         reporting in ThoughtSpot. Recommended fix: recompute ARR from MRR."
```

#### Layer 3 — Cleaning Decision Explanation
**Problem:** When SpotterPrep makes a cleaning decision, analysts need to understand and trust it.

**LLM Role:**
```
Input:  Cleaning action taken + before/after values + rule applied
Output: "I set 2,033 negative seats_used values to 0. A negative seat count
         is not meaningful — this appears to be a data entry error where a
         subtraction was applied instead of an assignment. Setting to 0 preserves
         the record while eliminating the invalid value."
```

#### Layer 4 — Cross-Column Context
**Problem:** The arr < mrr×12 rule is hard-coded. But what about `ltv < cac` (customer acquisition cost exceeds lifetime value)? Or `churn_risk = 'low'` but `health_score < 20`? These are domain-specific logic violations that can't all be pre-coded.

**LLM Role:**
```
Input:  All column names + sample data + column statistics
Output: "I notice that churn_risk and health_score appear inversely correlated.
         I found 234 rows where churn_risk = 'low' but health_score < 20.
         This may indicate stale churn risk labels. Flag for review?"
```
This is the highest-value LLM capability: discovering **novel, domain-specific logic violations** that aren't in the rulebook.

#### Layer 5 — Context Generation for ThoughtSpot
**Problem:** After cleaning, the analyst loads the data into ThoughtSpot. What does the data mean? What questions should they ask?

**LLM Role:**
```
Input:  Cleaned schema + profile statistics + data sample
Output: Auto-generated ThoughtSpot context document:
        - Suggested search terms ("What is total ARR by region?")
        - Column descriptions for ThoughtSpot's data model
        - Suggested formulas (NRR = (expansion_arr - contraction_arr - churned_arr) / starting_arr)
        - Anomaly alerts ("Revenue dropped 23% in March — possible data issue or real event?")
```

## 7. System Architecture for Implementation

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Data storage | Snowflake | Native to ThoughtSpot ecosystem |
| Profiling engine | Snowpark Python / Pandas | Run close to data |
| Cleaning execution | Snowpark Python | Transform inside Snowflake, no data movement |
| LLM calls | Claude API (claude-opus-4-6) | Schema understanding; claude-sonnet-4-6 for narrative |
| Orchestration | Snowflake Tasks / Airflow | Schedule profiling on table refresh |
| Output storage | Snowflake (SPOTTERPREP_TEST) | Cleaned tables in CLEANED schema |
| Report delivery | JSON profile + PDF | Profile JSON already implemented; PDF layer needed |

### Snowflake Schema Design

```sql
Database: SPOTTERPREP_TEST
├── Schema: RAW          -- Original tables, never modified
├── Schema: CLEANED      -- Cleaned output tables
└── Schema: PROFILES     -- Quality report tables (JSON → structured)

-- Suggested PROFILES table
CREATE TABLE SPOTTERPREP_TEST.PROFILES.QUALITY_REPORTS (
    table_name        VARCHAR,
    profiled_at       TIMESTAMP_NTZ,
    raw_rows          NUMBER,
    cleaned_rows      NUMBER,
    rows_deleted      NUMBER,
    rows_modified     NUMBER,
    quality_score_raw FLOAT,
    quality_score_clean FLOAT,
    grade_raw         VARCHAR(1),
    grade_clean       VARCHAR(1),
    issues_critical   NUMBER,
    issues_warning    NUMBER,
    full_profile_json VARIANT,   -- entire JSON blob
    created_at        TIMESTAMP_NTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
);
```

### Key Engineering Decisions to Make

1. **Where does cleaning run?** Snowpark (inside Snowflake) vs. external Python + write-back. Snowpark is better for data locality; external Python is easier to debug.

2. **How is schema evolution handled?** When the source table adds/removes columns, the profiler must detect and re-classify. LLM layer handles this dynamically.

3. **Is cleaning destructive?** The prototype creates separate CLEANED tables. A flag-only mode (add `_flag` columns to original) should also be supported.

4. **How are cleaning rules persisted?** The decision tree is currently in code. For production, rules should be stored in a config table so they can be overridden per-table or per-column without code changes.

5. **What triggers a re-profile?** On every table refresh? On schedule? On manual request? Snowflake Tasks + STREAM on source tables is the recommended trigger.

## 8. Appendix — Claude Code Prompts

If you want to generate additional artefacts directly from the codebase, run these prompts in Claude Code from the `data-profiling-agent` project directory:

---

**Generate a sample data comparison CSV for each dataset:**
```
For each of the 5 raw CSVs in data/raw/, read the first 20 rows and the
corresponding first 20 rows of the cleaned CSV in data/cleaned/. For each
dataset, write a side-by-side comparison CSV to data/samples/ that shows
the raw value and cleaned value for the 10 most interesting columns
(those with the most changes). Include a "change_type" column that labels
what rule was applied (e.g., "MONETARY_NEGATIVE", "CATEGORY_STANDARDISED").
```

---

**Generate a full HTML report with charts:**
```
Read all 5 profile JSONs from data/profiles/. Using matplotlib and jinja2,
generate a single HTML report at reports/spotterprep_report.html that includes:
- For each dataset: a bar chart of null rates per column group, a pie chart
  of issue counts by severity (CRITICAL/WARNING/INFO), and the pre/post
  quality score comparison
- A summary page with all 5 datasets side by side
- The full cleaning recommendation table for each dataset
```

---

**Generate the Snowflake validation queries:**
```
Write a SQL file at scripts/validate_snowflake.sql that, for each of the
10 tables in SPOTTERPREP_TEST (5 raw + 5 cleaned), runs:
1. Row count verification
2. Null rate check on the 5 most important columns
3. A specific issue verification query (e.g., for CUSTOMER_ORDERS verify
   that no negative order_amounts exist in the cleaned table)
4. A raw vs cleaned comparison query for 3 key metrics per dataset
```

---

**Generate an LLM context prompt for ThoughtSpot:**
```
Read the cleaned CSV for dataset1_customer_orders_cleaned.csv (first 1000 rows)
and the dataset1_profile.json. Write a prompt to send to Claude API that will
generate a ThoughtSpot data model context document: column descriptions,
suggested searches, recommended formulas, and 5 sample questions a sales
analyst would ask of this data. Show the Claude API call code using the
anthropic Python SDK and print the output.
```

---

**Generate the engineering-ready decision tree as executable config:**
```
Convert the SpotterPrep decision tree from the cleaning code in
scripts/gen_dataset1.py through gen_dataset5.py into a YAML config file
at config/cleaning_rules.yaml. The format should be:
  - column_pattern: regex or exact name
    column_type: MONETARY | TEMPORAL | PII | NUMERIC_PK | NUMERIC | CATEGORY
    rules: list of rule objects with action, condition, and parameters
This config file should be loadable by a generic cleaning engine that
applies the rules without dataset-specific code.
```
